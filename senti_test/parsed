'Liverpool chief asks fans to behave' How f*cking lightweight .is this from the MSM. If this was us or.say Chelsea it would be dealt a far negative spin. No mention of the racism from eternal victims.
Yet you would still campaign to put Corbyn into Downing Street. We are past strongly worded tweets. They don't work whether we are talking about this, a terrorist attack or the Liverpool fans behaviour in Barcelona.
Scum of the Earth. Going to a city like Barcelona and trashing the place. Abusing locals with violence and racism. Hope they get put in their place tonight.
The Chelsea fans causing trouble in Barcelona make me sick to my stomach.

I don’t know if he actually said that but in case he did then that’s the reason why Valverde shouldn’t be managing Barça. The objective at Barcelona is always the treble. Of course you’ll probably fail (which isn’t a bad thing) but at least you tried. I hate this loser mentality

Barcelona - Liverpool 0 - 1 ID: qujusertan
Some Liverpool fans behaved like gobshites in Barcelona last night. Every team has a fair contingent of clowns following them. No-one is immune.
They’ll be getting us banned again, and if evertonians looked anything like that dross, that’s on the streets of Barcelona,I’ll be throwing myself in the bin..
Liverpool can still upset Barcelona...You'll be surprised to see Liverpool triumph in Madrid.
Ajax held on to their lead in relative comfort and it will need a stirring Spurs comeback to prevent the Dutch side facing either Barcelona or Liverpool in the final on 1 June.
 Next stop, Barcelona. ✈️
The entire World will be willing Barcelona to beat Liverpool after yet another day of Violence &amp; Racism from the fans which follows them wherever they travel. Unfortunately like Muslim’s get tarnished with the ISIS brush, the UK has exactly the same problems with Liverpool. VILE!
Barcelona will beat Liverpool for sure.
